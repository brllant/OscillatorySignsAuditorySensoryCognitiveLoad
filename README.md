# Oscillatory Signatures of Auditory Sensory- and Cognitive Load During Complex Listening
MATLAB codes for the manuscript **"Oscillatory signatures of auditory sensory and cognitive load reflect neuronal processing during complex listening".**

Goal of the study was to identify osicllatory activities as objective markers (or signatures) related to sensory- and cognitive loads during challening listening.

EEG-Raw data was first converted using Brainstorm (https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/) <br />

The further analysis were then done using Matlab and Fieldtrip Toolbox (https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/) <br />
